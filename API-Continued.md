APIs continued

**Roy Fielding** One of the fathers of **HTTP**

## How I explained REST to my brother

**HTTP**: Is basically like GPS coordinates for information and knowledge.

The entire framework of the world wide web is built on **REST**

A **webpage** is essentially a representation of a resource that are pointed to by **URLs**. *(Or Representation of a concept)*

Machines are now and increasingly being able to use the web in the same way that people are able to, through **Web Services** and **APIs**.
